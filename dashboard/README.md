# MRT-3 Ridership Dashboard

A comprehensive Streamlit dashboard for analyzing Metro Rail Transit Line 3 ridership data from 1999 to March 2025. This dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights similar to the DOTR Railway Sector Datasets website.

## Features

### Overview Dashboard
- **Key Metrics**: Total ridership, average daily ridership, peak daily ridership, and data coverage
- **Annual Trends**: Yearly ridership totals and year-over-year growth analysis
- **Monthly Patterns**: Heatmap visualization of monthly ridership patterns
- **Key Insights**: Data coverage and growth trend summaries

### Trend Analysis
- **Time Series**: Daily ridership over time with interactive zooming
- **Moving Averages**: 30-day and 90-day moving averages for trend identification
- **Decade Comparison**: Analysis of ridership patterns across different decades

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Monthly Analysis**: Average daily ridership by month
- **Seasonal Heatmap**: Monthly ridership patterns by year
- **Day of Month Patterns**: Analysis of ridership by day of the month
- **Seasonal Insights**: Ridership patterns by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)

### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Comprehensive statistical summary
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histogram and box plot visualizations
- **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation matrix between variables
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification and visualization of outliers

### Predictive Analysis
- **Trend Projections**: 5-year ridership forecasts
- **Growth Rate Analysis**: Projected growth rates
- **Seasonal Forecasting**: Monthly pattern-based forecasting

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # If using git
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mrt
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the dashboard**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Run from dashboard directory (local development)
   cd mrt-3/dashboard
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   
   # Option 2: Run from mrt-3 root (deployment testing)
   cd mrt-3
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The dashboard will load automatically

**Note**: The dashboard expects the data file to be located at `../data/cleaned_ridership_data.csv` relative to the dashboard directory. This path structure is already configured in the application.

**Deployment**: For deployment platforms, use the `dashboard.py` file in the mrt-3 root directory, which automatically imports this dashboard.
